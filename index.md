| My name is Karoline Ceron and I am a biologist interested in trophic ecology. I have a Biology degree and Master's Degree from UNESC in Crici√∫ma (SC, Brazil) and  Ph.D. in Ecology and Conservation at UFMS in Campo Grande (MS, Brazil). I am a PostDoc Researcher at laboratory for studies on the structure and dynamics of diversity [(LDDiv)](http://www.mathiasmpires.net.br/) at UNICAMP. My current project involves the impact of extinctions on the functionality and evolutionary history in interaction networks between anurans and their prey and their contribution to pest and vector control.  | <img style="float: left;" src="DSC_5612.jpg" width="250" alt="My Image"> |
