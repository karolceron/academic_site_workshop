My name is Karoline Ceron and I am a biologist interested in trophic ecology. I have a Biology degree and Master's Degree from UNESC in Criciúma (SC, Brazil) and  Ph.D. in Ecology and Conservation at UFMS in Campo Grande (MS, Brazil). My current project involves anuran trophic networks in several ecoregions in Brazil (Atlantic Forest, Chaco, Cerrado, and Pantanal) in face of climate change. Since my bachelor’s degree, I am a proactive researcher, seeking to understand the processes that are molding communities and exploring the variables underlying these processes. | ![eu](DSC_5612.jpg)
