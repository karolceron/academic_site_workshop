excerpt: "About Me..."

My name is Karoline Ceron and I am a biologist interested in trophic ecology. I have a Biology degree and Master's Degree from UNESC in Criciúma (SC, Brazil) and  Ph.D. in Ecology and Conservation at UFMS in Campo Grande (MS, Brazil). I am a PostDoc Researcher at laboratory for studies on the structure and dynamics of diversity [(LDDiv)](http://www.mathiasmpires.net.br/). My current project involves the impact of extinctions on the functionality and evolutionary history in interaction networks
between anurans and their prey and their contribution to pest and vector control. Since my bachelor’s degree, I am a proactive researcher, seeking to understand the processes that are molding communities and exploring the variables underlying these processes. | ![eu](DSC_5612.jpg)
